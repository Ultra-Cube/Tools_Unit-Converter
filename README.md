How it works:

The user types a number (e.g., 1.5) into the top input field.

The user selects the unit of that number from the dropdown menu (e.g., Miles).

The app instantly calculates and displays the converted value in the bottom field.

The bottom dropdown shows the target unit (Kilometers).

The arrows in the middle indicate the direction of conversion. They could also be buttons to "flip" the conversion direction.

HTML: For the structure (input fields, dropdowns, labels).

CSS: For making it look clean and presentable.

JavaScript: For the magic—listening to user input and doing the math.
